[The pages are thin, as if afraid to bear the weight of what they carry. The handwriting is steady, elegant, almost tired.]

To the one who stands where we once stood —

You have slain the Witness, broken the seal of silence, and stepped beyond the reach of gods. Few ever dared, fewer still survived.

I wonder, as I write these final words:

Will you make the same mistakes as ours?

We built worlds from whispers, sculpted rivers from breath, forged life from hunger. We thought the Flow was ours to command.

But the Flow never obeyed — it only reflected. Our fears birthed monsters. Our pride forged chains. Our mercy turned to decay.

Now you hold what we once held: the truth. You have seen the hollow sky and the endless fire, felt the hum of the core beneath all things.

Does it hurt?
Or is it comforting to know the world is no accident — that it was shaped, fought over, loved and broken by hands like yours?

What you carry now is heavier than any crown, sharper than any blade. You may bind the Flow again, weave a world free of our shadows — or twist it, as we did, until it screams.

This is not prophecy. It is not warning. It is a mirror.

Look into it, and choose.

— Erethis, last of the Weavers

[A final line, scratched faintly in the margin:]

“Creation is a wound. We decide whether it heals, or festers.”
