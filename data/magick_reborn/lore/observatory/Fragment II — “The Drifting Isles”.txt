“Stone floats as though the world forgot it.
Entire mountains hang in the endless night, roots of ore exposed like teeth.

Yet they shift. Slowly. Patiently.
The pattern of their movement is no accident — the orbits whisper of a design.
I have begun to sketch them, but the shapes refuse to remain still on the page.”
