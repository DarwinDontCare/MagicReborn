“Crystals hum in the stillness — threads of frozen light anchored in void-stone.
When touched, they spark, not with heat, but with memory.

I saw a vision: a world unformed, a weave without pattern, the Flow spilling in rivers of white flame.

Then I saw myself, older, mouth open in a scream I could not hear.
I will not touch them again.”
