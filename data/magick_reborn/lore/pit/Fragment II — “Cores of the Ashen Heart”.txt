“Beneath the molten tides lie stones that beat like drums — warm, pulsing, almost alive.
We call them Ashen Hearts.

They feed on the Flow itself, drawing magic like water through stone.
When held, they whisper shapes into the mind — weapons, gates, even faces.

I carved one open. Inside: silence, heavier than sound.”
