“A dying man will agree to anything.
The Abyss offers him strength — heat in place of flesh, a spine of blackened iron.

The body survives. The man does not.

They march now without hunger, without sleep. They do not breathe, yet their chests rise with the heat of a kiln.
I have named them Furnace-born — soldiers with no end but ash.”
