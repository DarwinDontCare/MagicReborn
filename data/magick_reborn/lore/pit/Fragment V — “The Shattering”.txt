“The Weavers who turned to the Abyss sought permanence.
They wanted bodies that could not rot, flames that could not dim, power that did not fade.

But the Abyss bargains only in hollows.
To gain, you must give.
And so they gave their memories, their voices, their faces.

Now they wander like statues in heat-shimmer — perfect, eternal, empty.”
