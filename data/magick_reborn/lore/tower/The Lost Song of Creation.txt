“Before the sun warmed the stone, before the rivers found their beds, there was only the Flow.”

The world was not born by chance, but from a primordial weave of magic, known simply as the Flow. From it came land, sea, sky, and creature. But among all beings, only a few could hear the Flow’s voice and shape reality itself. These first sorcerers, the Weavers, walked among gods and mortals alike.

As ages passed, the Weavers divided, drawn toward two supreme wells of power — each a mirror of creation’s extremes:

The Void – the Silent Expanse, an ethereal ocean of floating isles. It is said that within it rests the Dragon of the Last Horizon, a guardian born to protect secrets even the gods feared. Among the drifting islands lie ancient crystals and treasures, suspended in gravity’s ruin, carrying the echo of lost spells.

The Abyss – the Burning Hollow, an endless cavern of fire and stone, where the earth itself bleeds molten rivers. Beneath the incandescent waves lie Ashen Hearts, living gems capable of reshaping flesh and spirit — at a terrible cost. Some claim the Weavers buried themselves in the Abyss, corrupted by its lure.

But the Weavers are gone. Legends whisper that they were devoured by their own creations, or that they transcended mortal form, becoming one with the Flow itself. All that remains are forsaken structures: broken towers, observatories staring into the dark, pits that bleed heat into the deep.

Now, magic is no longer taught.
It must be rediscovered.
Fragments of scrolls, torn books, incomplete accounts — the only remnants of a world where magic shaped, destroyed, and renewed reality itself.

Those who gather the right pieces, who dare to travel where the Flow still whispers, may decide the fate of this world — to restore it, or to plunge it forever into the Void’s silence or the Abyss’s roar.
